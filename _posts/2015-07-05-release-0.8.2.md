This is a minor new release, the [third alpha version](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/optimizationBenchmarking/releases/tag/v0.8.2)
of our *optimizationBenchmarking.org* evaluator.

You can download it from our [Maven repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/repo/optimizationBenchmarking/org/optimizationBenchmarking/0.8.2/index.html), which includes a stand-alone binary, or from [GitHub](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/optimizationBenchmarking/releases/tag/v0.8.2), where only the sources are provided.

The robustness of the software has been improved, in particular it no longer strictly
requires a Java JDK, but can also run under a JRE. If the evaluator is executed under
a JDK and loads experiment data, it will automatically generate and compile data
container classes which are tailored to the kind of data being read. Under a JRE,
we will no longer throw an exception and terminate, but instead use fall-back
classes. These classes are both slower and require more memory than the tailored ones,
but at least the system will work properly.

We further removed some bug occurring when running the software under Windows.

Finally, there now are also ready-to-execute scripts for Windows. These scripts
will automatically download the evaluator and example data sets and then evaluate
these data sets on your machine and generate reports.

together with some examples have been updated as well.
