The first [alpha version](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/optimizationBenchmarking/releases/tag/v0.8.0) of the *optimizationBenchmarking.org* evaluator has been released, together with a first version of the project introduction slides and two examples.

You can download this version from our [Maven repository]({{ site.baseurl }}/repo/optimizationBenchmarking/org/optimizationBenchmarking/0.8.0/index.html), which includes a stand-alone binary, or from [GitHub](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/optimizationBenchmarking/releases/tag/v0.8.0), where only the sources are provided.

This version is already functional although it still lacks some major features and *may* be buggy. The generated reports are still empty except for the figures, several features of the [TSP Suite](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/tspSuite) evaluator are missing and will be implemented step-by-step into this more general evaluator component.
