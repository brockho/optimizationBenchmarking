The web site of the main *optimizationBenchmarking.org* evaluator has been created. The project is still in an early development stage without any release, so currently we just want to test how to create a web site with [GitHub](http://www.github.com) pages. Later, this web site will host the executables, source code, documentation, and examples for the *optimizationBenchmarking.org* evaluator.
