# Introduction

This is the main repository of the <em>optimizationBenchmarking.org</em> framework.
This framework is a Java&nbsp;1.7 software designed to make the evaluation, benchmarking, and comparison of optimization or Machine Learning algorithms
easier. It can load log files created by an optimization or Machine Learning process, evaluate
how the process has progressed over time, and compare its performance to other processes. It
can create reports in LaTeX or XHTML formats or export its findings in text files which may later
be loaded by other applications.  

The current version of this software is <a href="{{ site.data.currentVersion.currentVersionRepo }}">{{ site.data.currentVersion.currentVersion }}</a>.
A stand-alone <code>jar</code> is provided <a href="{{ site.data.currentVersion.currentVersionStandAloneJarURL }}">here</a> and
a set of slides introducing the whole framework and providing examples can be found
<a href="http://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/optimizationBenchmarking/raw/documentation/documents/evaluatorSlides/evaluatorSlides.pdf">here</a>.
