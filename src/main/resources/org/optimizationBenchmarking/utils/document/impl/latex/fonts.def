% The textcomp package provides a command called \capitaldotaccent
% but no corresponding command for lower case letters.
% Normally, the right way to get a "c" with a dot above would
% be writing {\.{c}}. However, some BibTeX styles [1] eat all dots,
% so we would get {\{c}}, which explodes. Thus we define the
% command below.
