This version solves a long-standing problem with the [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) output.
As you may know, the software can generate algorithm performance
reports in LaTeX format and automatically compile them to pdf.

Since our evaluator is quite versatile and its modules can generate
series of figures with charts, I developed the LaTeX package
[`figureSeries`](https://github.com/thomasWeise/figureSeries) with
floating figures which can break over multiple pages. This was
needed, as we can have figures with arbitrarily many sub-figures and
the software cannot determine how much space they will occupy in the
final document, i.e., LaTeX must handle the layout. Unfortunately,
my `figureSeries` had some bugs, e.g., would sometimes generate
`Float(s) lost` errors during LaTeX compilation. This bug has been
fixed in the new version [0.9.4](https://github.com/thomasWeise/figureSeries/releases/tag/v0.9.4) of that package. We now internally make use of the great [`cuted`](http://ctan.org/pkg/cuted)
package in `figureSeries`, which turned out to work better than my own code. Thus, LaTeX document generation and compilation is now more robust.

There are also some improvements in the LaTeX tool chain that we
use for compiling the documents automatically. Our evaluator can
automatically detect whether and where LaTeX is installed on the
system. Depending on the type of document you generate, it will
try to configure a proper tool chain for compilation depending on
what you have installed. The code for this has been cleaned up
and consolidated, and we now also support [LuaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX)
(besides standard [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX),
[pdfTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PdfTeX), and
[XeTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX)).

All in all, nothing much changed on the surface, but you should
be seeing less errors and the software became a bit more robust.
