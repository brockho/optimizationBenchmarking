## Dear Sonatype and Maven Central Team.

I am working on an open source software framework for research on optimization algorithms. This project is rather large and contains many different aspects (drawing charts, generating reports either in XHTML or LaTeX, statistical evaluation of data, Machine Learning, etc). I am dividing it into several smaller libraries, each targeting one concern (utils-base for general utils, utils-graphics for generating graphics, utils-charts for painting diagrams, etc). I would like to make each of these sub-projects available on the central repository under the group-id "org.optimizationBenchmarking". I will create several more such sub-projects (utils-ml, utils-math, evaluator, etc.) in the next few weeks. Each of them can be useful to other people.

I own the domain http://www.optimizationBenchmarking.org. It currently points to the project page http://optimizationbenchmarking.github.io/optimizationBenchmarking/ where the previous version of whole project can be downloaded as one archive and which is hosted at GitHub. I put a file http://optimizationbenchmarking.github.io/optimizationBenchmarking/ownership into this page. Into this file copied the text of this issue in order to verify that I am truly the owner of said domain. I do not have email set up for this domain.
