optimizationBenchmarking
========================

The main repository of the optimizationBenchmarking.org tool suite.
With this project, we aim at providing a tool suite for evaluating and
comparing the performance of optimization algorithms.

Optimization algorithms are algorithms which can find (approximate)
solutions for computationall hard (e.g., NP-hard) problems. Since they
solve hard problems, they will often not be able to find the best
(globally optimal) solution within feasible runtime. However, they
may be anytime algorithms which start with a more or less random (and
hence usually bad) approximation of the solution and improve this
approximation during their course. Comparing two such algorithms
is not an easy thing, since it involves comparing behavior over runtime.

In this project, we try to provide a set of tools to make this process
easier.
