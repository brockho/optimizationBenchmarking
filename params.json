Since they\r\nsolve hard problems, they will often not be able to find the best\r\n(globally optimal) solution within feasible runtime. However, they\r\nmay be anytime algorithms which start with a more or less random (and\r\nhence usually bad) approximation of the solution and improve this\r\napproximation during their course. Comparing two such algorithms\r\nis not an easy thing, since it involves comparing behavior over runtime.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we try to provide a set of tools to make this process\r\neasier.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
